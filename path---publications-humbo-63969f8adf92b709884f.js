With a well-designed dialogue system as an intelligent personal assistant, people can accomplish certain tasks more easily via natural language interactions. Today there are several virtual intelligent assistants in the market; however, most systems only focus on textual or vocal interaction. In this paper, we present HUMBO, a system aiming at generating dialogue responses and simultaneously synthesize corresponding visual expressions on faces for better multimodal interaction. HUMBO can (1) let users determine the appearances of virtual assistants by a single image, and (2) generate coherent emotional utterances and facial expressions on the user-provided image. This is not only a brand new research direction but more importantly, an ultimate step toward more human-like virtual assistants.</p>',fields:{tagSlugs:["/tags/dialogue-systems/","/tags/multimodal-systems/","/tags/response-generation/","/tags/natural-language-generation/"]},frontmatter:{title:"HUMBO: Bridging Response Generation and Facial Expression Synthesis",tags:["Dialogue Systems","Multimodal Systems","Response Generation","Natural Language Generation"],date:"2021-8-19T22:40:32.169Z",description:"Shang-Yu Su*, Po-Wei Lin*, Yun-Nung Chen",conference:"arXiv"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/publications/humbo/"}}}});
