However, one of the fatal drawbacks in such approaches is that they are unable to generate informative utterances, so it limits their usage from some real-world conversational applications. This paper attempts at generating diverse and informative responses with a variational generation model, which contains a joint attention mechanism conditioning on the information from both dialogue contexts and extra knowledge.</p>',fields:{tagSlugs:["/tags/dialogue/","/tags/response-generation/"]},frontmatter:{title:"Knowledge-Grounded Response Generation with Deep Attentional Latent-Variable Model",tags:["Dialogue","Response Generation"],date:"2018-12-6T22:40:32.169Z",description:"Hao-Tong Ye, Kai-Ling Lo, Shang-Yu Su, and Yun-Nung Chen",conference:"DSTC7/Computer Speech and Language 2020"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/publications/aaai2019-dstc7-cvae/"}}}});
