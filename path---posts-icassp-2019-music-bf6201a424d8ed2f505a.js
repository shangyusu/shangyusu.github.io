The proposed framework is capable of generating distinct melodies that sounds natural, and the experiments for evaluating generated music clips show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines in human evaluation. (The first three authors contributed equally.)</p>',fields:{tagSlugs:["/tags/music-information-retrieval/","/tags/generation/","/tags/vae/"]},frontmatter:{title:"Modeling Melodic Feature Dependency with Modularized Variational Auto-Encoder",tags:["Music Information Retrieval","Generation","VAE"],date:"2019-02-7T22:40:32.169Z",description:"Yu-An Wang*, Yu-Kai Huang*, Tzu-Chuan Lin*, Shang-Yu Su, and Yun-Nung Chen",conference:"ICASSP2019"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/posts/icassp2019-music/"}}}});
